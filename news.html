      <h4>Fredbear killer?</h4>

      <p>Fredbear’s Family Diner, once a bustling neighborhood spot known for its singing animatronics and all-you-can-eat birthday specials, has announced it will close its doors indefinitely following last week’s shocking accident involving one of its mechanical mascots.</p>

      <p>The incident—already being referred to by locals as “the Bite”—occurred during a birthday party on July 24th. According to police, a child was severely injured when the restaurant’s signature animatronic, “Fredbear,” malfunctioned during a performance. Witnesses reported that the character’s jaw clamped down unexpectedly, causing what authorities described as “critical head trauma.”</p>

      <p>The victim, a young boy whose name has not been released due to his age, remains hospitalized. Authorities have not commented on his current condition.</p>

      <p>Parents who were present that day described the scene as chaotic. “At first we all thought it was part of the show,” said one mother, who asked not to be named. “Then people started screaming. It was horrible.”</p>

      <p>The diner, co-owned by Fredbear Entertainment and its subsidiary Fazbear Entertainment, released a brief statement yesterday confirming the restaurant’s closure. “We are cooperating fully with local law enforcement and safety inspectors. Our thoughts are with the family affected by this unfortunate incident,” the statement read.</p>

      <p>Though the company declined to comment on whether the shutdown will be permanent, employees say they’ve been told to collect their belongings. One staff member, who had worked at the diner for six years, expressed sadness but not surprise. “The animatronics have been acting strange for months,” he said. “Jittery movements, delayed responses… We reported it, but nothing ever seemed to get fixed properly. They just kept telling us it was normal wear.”</p>

      <p>Local regulators are now investigating potential negligence in maintenance procedures. State safety officials have temporarily suspended operating licenses for all animatronic-equipped venues owned by Fazbear Entertainment pending review.</p>

      <p>The diner, opened in 1983, has long been a staple of children’s entertainment in the region. Families would travel from neighboring towns to celebrate birthdays to the tune of Fredbear and his companion, Spring Bonnie, performing on stage. The news of its sudden closure has left many residents stunned.</p>

      <p>For now, the building sits dark and quiet—balloons still tied to railings inside, tables still set for parties that will never arrive. A handwritten sign taped to the front door reads simply: “Closed Until Further Notice.”</p>

      <p>As the investigation continues, questions linger: Was this a tragic one-off malfunction, or a sign of deeper problems within the company’s growing animatronic entertainment empire?</p>

      <p>For many in Hurricane, the magic of Fredbear’s has dimmed—and may never return.</p>
